The program must use a command-line argument (argv and argc) 
to specify a filename to be loaded. After checking for a valid 
command-line entry, your program must open the file and read 
in each word to see how many words there are. Then, using a 
dynamically allocated array of structures, re-read in each 
word and store it in the dynamically allocated array of 
structures. Use rewind to rewind the file. Do NOT close and 
reopen the file, use rewind instead.
